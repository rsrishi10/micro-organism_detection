Due to several factors like Air pollution, industrial waste, mining activities etc, the issue of water contamination is increasing day by day. The rising levels of water contamination are making us more aware of the need to protect the health and safety of others. Traditional machine learning algorithms often break problems down into smaller modules and solve them module by module. However, modern detection algorithms need to operate end-to-end, with faster computation times. Real-time detection and classification of objects is essential for generating various analytical insights. It is frequently observed that, these types of tasks when used with smaller dataset often face challenges like incorrect results and slow processing speeds. To address the above problems, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) detection and classification approach (YOLOv9) is employed on custom dataset to enhance computation speed and processing efficiency. This algorithm uses a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to boost processing speed and generates bounding boxes with annotations for each detected object class.
